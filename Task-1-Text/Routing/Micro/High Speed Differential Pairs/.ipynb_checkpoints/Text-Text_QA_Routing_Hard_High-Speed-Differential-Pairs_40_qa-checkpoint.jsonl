{"id": "qa_0", "question": "How to design a reference plane switching area to prevent the reflow path from breaking when high-speed differential pairs traverse multi-layer structures?", "answer": "Ground via bridging is introduced at the reference plane switching to ensure that the return current is continuous, and the length of the impedance jump zone is matched, and a compensation structure is added to reduce reflection if necessary."}
{"id": "qa_1", "question": "When an AC-coupled capacitor needs to be connected to the differential pair end, how to ensure the internal impedance continuity?", "answer": "Use a symmetrical layout and equal capacitance values while matching the trace lengths near the coupling capacitors and arrange them as close to the load or receiver as possible to reduce reflections"}
