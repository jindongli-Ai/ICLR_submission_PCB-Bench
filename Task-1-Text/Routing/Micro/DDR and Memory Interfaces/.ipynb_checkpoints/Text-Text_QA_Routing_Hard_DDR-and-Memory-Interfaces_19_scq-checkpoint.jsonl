{"id": "scq_0", "question": "How should DDR bus routing be handled to meet strict timing requirements?", "options": [["A", "By introducing the combination of multi-layer ground reference surfaces and clock distribution matrix, the long serpentine trace on the critical path is used to enhance the synchronous control ability and improve the signal convergence speed of the entire subsystem"], ["B", "It is recommended to use source-compensated capacitors near the address line pins for noise reduction, while single-ended traces are used to improve routing flexibility and uniformize the slope of the driver edges"], ["C", "The control line and data signal can be pulled out to the edge of the board for matching network layout to improve the echo interference between modules and reduce the overlapping area of signal reflection"], ["D", "The address, control, and data signals should be routed equal length, and the traces should be symmetrical, and the serpentine line should be used to compensate for the length"], ["E", "None of the above options are correct"]], "correct_answer": "D"}
