{"id": "scq_0", "question": "How to prevent radiated interference in mmWave signal routing?", "options": [["A", "It is recommended to isolate the signal by coupling capacitors after converting it to a double-ended structure, and add a limiting filter at the end of the path to reduce reflections"], ["B", "Microstrip or ribbon structure should be used, the impedance accuracy should be controlled, and the radiation should be shielded by a complete grounding structure"], ["C", "It is recommended to use high-frequency low-dielectric materials and compress the trace width to enhance signal concentration, and introduce absorbing layers to weaken the distal radiation coupling"], ["D", "Single-layer ribbon transmission can be used to reduce costs, but it is necessary to avoid too many frequency jump points to simplify the analysis path"], ["E", "None of the above options are correct"]], "correct_answer": "B"}
{"id": "scq_1", "question": "Can RF signal paths cross power reference planes?", "options": [["A", "It is recommended to add auxiliary inductors and ground channels in the power supply area to form a coupled suppression structure to ensure the integrity of the high-frequency reflow path"], ["B", "Balanced cross-routing structure can be used to optimize mode distribution between the upper and lower power supply layers, and multi-point ground via arrays can be set up at the critical interface to enhance equivalent isolation"], ["C", "It is not recommended that RF signals only cross the ground plane to avoid current disturbance and return instability"], ["D", "The signal path can be temporarily crossed on a single power supply layer, but the ground bridge and impedance compensation need to be used to avoid the problem of multi-point cross-interference"], ["E", "None of the above options are correct"]], "correct_answer": "C"}
