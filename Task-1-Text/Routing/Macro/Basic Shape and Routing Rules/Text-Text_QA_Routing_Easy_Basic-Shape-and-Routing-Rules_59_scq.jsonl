{"id": "scq_0", "question": "What principle should be followed when routing between two points?", "options": [["A", "Preferentially use diagonal routing to bypass ground level obstacles to reduce interference path crossing"], ["B", "It should be as short and straight as possible, reducing turns and improving signal integrity"], ["C", "All signal lines should be of uniform length and routed at the top layer to avoid impedance jumps caused by cross-layer"], ["D", "Serpentine trace equal length compensation is used between two points to enhance the path flexibility and debugging tolerance of the wiring"], ["E", "None of the above options are correct"]], "correct_answer": "B"}
{"id": "scq_1", "question": "How should clock signals be routed?", "options": [["A", "The clock line should be uniformly connected to all slave modules in parallel to ensure level synchronization and simplify signal control logic"], ["B", "The traces should be short and straight, avoid interference sources, and add terminal resistors if necessary"], ["C", "All clock lines should be routed through the analog area to ensure timing synchronization with the master control area"], ["D", "The clock signal is amplified by the intermediate driver and broadcast to multiple receivers to save the drive current"], ["E", "None of the above options are correct"]], "correct_answer": "B"}
