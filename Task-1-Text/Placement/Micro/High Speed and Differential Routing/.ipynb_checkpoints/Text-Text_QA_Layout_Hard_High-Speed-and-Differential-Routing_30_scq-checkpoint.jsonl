{"id": "scq_0", "question": "How to route multiple synchronous ADC sampling channels to minimize phase error?", "options": [["A", "All sampled signals are traced to the main control area, and the timestamp is unified through the logical scheduling algorithm, but the inconsistent physical delay can easily lead to phase drift"], ["B", "The wiring sequence is based on the module layout, and the signal length difference is adjusted by terminal compensation filtering, but there is an analog bandwidth inconsistency"], ["C", "The length of the sampling signal link should be strictly controlled, the wiring should be symmetrical, and the cross-interference of asynchronous control signals should be avoided"], ["D", "All ADC inputs can be routed in series to save jumping between layers, but will introduce a difference in signal delay before and after to widen the phase error"], ["E", "None of the above options are correct"]], "correct_answer": "C"}
