{"id": "scq_0", "question": "In EV designs, how should HV power modules be co-located with low-voltage logic circuits?", "options": [["A", "High and low voltage areas should be arranged alternately and filtering modules should be added to simplify the design process by unifying the ground wire"], ["B", "The high voltage and low voltage areas are interspersed with each other to save space, and the common interface is used to achieve signal connectivity"], ["C", "The high voltage and low voltage areas should be clearly divided, and the interference path should be isolated by multi-point shielding and digital isolation chips"], ["D", "The high-voltage circuit is close to the main power supply path layout, and the low-voltage area is coupled with a double filter group through transformer coupling"], ["E", "None of the above options are correct"]], "correct_answer": "C"}
{"id": "scq_1", "question": "How to optimize antenna feed paths in 5G mmWave front-end modules?", "options": [["A", "The feed path extends the antenna coupling area by bending the wiring while avoiding phase drift caused by signal interference"], ["B", "The feed path should be kept to the shortest length and matched to avoid phase mismatch caused by metal trace turning"], ["C", "The feeder wire adopts multiple layers of serpentine traces to reduce space utilization and improves signal stability with bypass capacitors"], ["D", "Feed traces are arranged close to the shield to enhance directionality while moving away from high-frequency devices to reduce common-mode interference"], ["E", "None of the above options are correct"]], "correct_answer": "B"}
