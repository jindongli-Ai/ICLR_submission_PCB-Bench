{"id": "scq_0", "question": "In high-reliability military comm boards, how to place redundant channels for EMC and thermal robustness?", "options": [["A", "Redundant channels are arranged adjacent to the main channel to simplify wiring, and heat sources are concentrated on one side to enhance heat dissipation consistency"], ["B", "The primary/standby channels are physically isolated and symmetrically arranged on both sides of the heat source to avoid common-mode path interference"], ["C", "Uniform routing direction across all channels for enhanced electrical connectivity and improved thermal equalization through vias"], ["D", "The channels are arranged in the middle layer, and the redundant signal balance structure is constructed by using upper and lower symmetrical copper laying"], ["E", "None of the above options are correct"]], "correct_answer": "B"}
{"id": "scq_1", "question": "How to manage thermal coupling in current-controlled high-frequency power amplifier layouts?", "options": [["A", "All temperature sensors are concentrated on the amplifier side and are continuously heated to improve response speed"], ["B", "The temperature sensor is symmetrically distributed on both sides of the amplifier, and the independent copper skin is used to conduct heat and keep the air flow smooth"], ["C", "The amplifier hot zone covers the entire bottom layer and is supplemented by a heat sink, which isolates the heat conduction path through a thick dielectric layer"], ["D", "The sensor is arranged below the output path, and the dynamic change of temperature rise is judged by signal layer coupling"], ["E", "None of the above options are correct"]], "correct_answer": "B"}
