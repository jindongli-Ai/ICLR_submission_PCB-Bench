{"id": "scq_1", "question": "What should be considered when placing the power input port?", "options": [["A", "It should be as close as possible to the main control chip and the ADC module"], ["B", "Close to the edge of the board and reserve enough copper skin for current bearing"], ["C", "It should be arranged in the middle of the board to facilitate and balance the routing in all directions"], ["D", "It should be close to the analog area to reduce the power supply delay path"], ["E", "None of the above options are correct"]], "correct_answer": "B"}
