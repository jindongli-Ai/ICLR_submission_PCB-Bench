# PCB-Bench (ICLR 2026 Submission)

1. This is a temporary repository created for the ICLR 2026 submission of *PCB-Bench*.
   
2. We only provide a small subset of the dataset here, with 1â€“2 examples placed in each directory, in order to protect intellectual property.
   
3. The full dataset and code will be released once the paper is accepted by the conference.
