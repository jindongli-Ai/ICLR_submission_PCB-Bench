Overview\nThis PCB is a combination of the RTL8367S and RTL8213B chips, forming a gigabit switch with an SFP interface. It supports both gigabit Ethernet and SFP interfaces, providing high-speed network connections for various devices. The power input section is compatible with two types of interfaces: a standard 5.5mm DC jack and a Type-C interface, offering users flexibility in choosing the appropriate power input method.\n2. Function Description  \n- Gigabit Switch Function: Integrated with the RTL8367S switch chip, it supports high-speed data forwarding, providing gigabit network connections.  \n- SFP Interface: The board offers an SFP interface, allowing for use with optical modules for long-distance network connections.  \n- Power Supply: The board supports two power input interfaces, a standard 5.5mm DC jack and a Type-C interface.  \n- Voltage Regulator Chip: The TPS54335A DC-DC buck converter from Ti is used, supporting a wide input voltage range of 4.5V to 28V. It avoids using the internal buck output of the switch chip, reducing chip heat generation.\n3. Working Principle  \nThe switch uses the RTL8367S chip as the core for managing multiple Ethernet ports, while the SFP interface provides long-distance network connectivity. Power is supplied through either the 5.5mm DC jack or Type-C interface, and the voltage is regulated by the TPS54335A buck converter, ensuring stable operation for all components on the board.\n4. Test Parameters  \n- Input Voltage: The board supports a wide input voltage range (4.5V to 28V), with two different power input options available.  \n- Network Performance: It supports gigabit-speed data transmission, suitable for high-speed data exchange.  \n- Power Consumption and Temperature: The external voltage regulator reduces heat generation within the chip, ensuring stable operation.\n5. Circuit Overview  \nThe circuit uses the RTL8367S chip as the core for the switch, supporting multiple gigabit Ethernet ports and the SFP interface. The TPS54335A chip is used for power management, converting the input voltage to a stable level for the components on the board. Capacitors, resistors, and other components are used for power and signal filtering, ensuring efficient operation.\n6. Notes  \n- Power Selection: The power supply must be within the recommended range of 4.5V to 28V to ensure proper system operation.  \n- SFP Interface Usage: The SFP interface requires compatible optical modules for use, ensuring stable network connections and long-distance communication.", "Question": "Briefly describe the function of this PCB board, covering as many aspects as possible while keeping the language concise.", "ImagePath": "img_1.png"}
